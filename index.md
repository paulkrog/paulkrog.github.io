## Paul Krogmeier

I'm a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard advised by [Nada Amin][nada] and
[Walter Fontana][walter]. My primary area of research touches
programming languages, logic, and formal methods.

<!-- Currently we are exploring ... evolutionary algorithms -->
<!-- program synthesis. -->

I will be joining the [University of Colorado Boulder][cu] as an
assistant professor in computer science starting Fall 2026. I received
a PhD from the [University of Illinois][uiuc] advised by [Madhusudan
Parthasarathy][madhu].

I'm also a jazz alto saxophone player ðŸŽ· and always interested in
chances to jam. Shoot me an email if you'd like to talk about anything
below.

### Ongoing Projects

<section id="projects">
<ul class="custom-list">

<li><b>Emergence of symbolic language:</b> developing a computational
model in which symbolic language and abstraction are emergent outcomes
of computation</li>

<li><b>DSL synthesis:</b> theory and algorithms for
automatically synthesizing DSLs that
express relevant domain concepts succinctly and irrelevant ones less
succinctly or not at all  </li>


<!-- <li><b>Example-driven geometry proofs</b>: using small diagrams to guide -->
<!-- auxiliary constructions in geometry proofs </li> -->
