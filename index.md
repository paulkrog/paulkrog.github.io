I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign][uiuc] in the department of [Computer Science][cs]
working with [Madhusudan Parthasarathy][madhu]. I am also an avid jazz
alto saxophone player ðŸŽ·. Shoot me an email if you'd like to talk
about anything below.

## Ongoing Projects

<section id="projects">
<ul>

<li><b>DSL synthesis:</b> foundational theory and algorithms for
automatically synthesizing domain-specific languages that
express relevant domain concepts succinctly and irrelevant ones less
succinctly or not at all  </li>

<li><b>Emergence of symbolic language:</b> developing a computational
model in which symbolic language and abstraction are emergent outcomes
of computation</li>

<li><b>Example-driven geometry proofs</b>: using small diagrams to guide
auxiliary constructions in geometry proofs </li>

</ul>
