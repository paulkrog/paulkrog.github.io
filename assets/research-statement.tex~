My primary interests is lie at the intersection of formal logic and
learning. Particularly, I would like design learning algorithms that
represent information symbolically, perhaps in the form of logical
sentences. Such algorithms should be interpretable. By this I mean
that a good learner should learn to represent knowledge in such a way
that all hypotheses include an explanation of why a particular concept
was learned. I think this a broadly useful, but rather vague
criterion.
